# React-Chart-Libraries
Contains examples of how to implement charts using react-vis, recharts &amp; react-chartjs2


## How to use it?

- Install all the dependencies. Keep in mind that you’ll have to force the installation since 
`react-vis` is not compatible with the React version that the project is using (v18). Run `npm install --force`

- Run npm run dev since it’s a project that was created using Vite
